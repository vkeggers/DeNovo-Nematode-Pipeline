## Getting linux terminal on Windows
</summary>

Check if you can use liux commands without installing anything:

1) open the command line or powershell and type some linux command like 'ls' or 'ssh'
2) If it works, great! If not, you may need to proceed with the following steps or do some other kind of trouble-shooting

Installing linux in windows shell:

If you have a windows10 or newer, open powershell in administrator mode:

1) type powershell in search bar
2) right click powershell
3) click 'open as administrator'

```
wsl --install
```

This will take a few moments. It will not work if you have wsl already. It will prompt you for a username and password. It will then create a linux folder. navigate through the file system and find your username. Files you download through scp or sftp will likely end up here by default.
